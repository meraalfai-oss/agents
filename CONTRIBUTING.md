## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. Git installed locally
3. Familiarity with Git workflows (branching, pull requests, etc.)
4. Understanding of the repository's purpose and structure

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

   ```bash
   # Fork via GitHub UI, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agents.git
   cd agents
   ```

2. **Clone the repository** (if you're a collaborator)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meraalfai-oss/agents.git
   cd agents
   ```

3. **Set up remote upstream** (for forks)
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/meraalfai-oss/agents.git
   ```

   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

## üîÑ Contribution Process

### 1. Choose Your Contribution Type

#### Standard Changes
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Minor feature additions
- Tool configuration updates

**Process**: 
- Timeline: 2-5 business days
- Requires: 1 maintainer approval
- Review: Standard PR review

#### Significant Changes
- Major features
- Breaking changes
- Governance updates
- Architecture changes

**Process**:
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks
- Requires: 2+ maintainer approvals
- Review: RFC process, thorough review, testing

### 2. Create a Branch

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
```bash
# For features
git checkout -b feature/description

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/description

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/description

# For automated agents (Copilot, etc.)
git checkout -b copilot/description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Follow these principles:

#### Minimal Changes
- Make the smallest possible changes to achieve your goal
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Keep changes focused and atomic

#### Quality Standards
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass
- No linting errors

#### Security
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit message format
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description

- Detailed point about what changed
- Another detail about implementation
- Reference to related issue: #123"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines**:
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Provide context in the body if needed
- Reference related issues or PRs

### 5. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch
4. Fill out the PR template (if provided)
5. Provide a clear description:
   - What changes were made
   - Why they were needed
   - How they were tested
   - Any breaking changes or special considerations

#### PR Description Template

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% line coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- All public APIs must be tested

### Test Types
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Test complete workflows (where applicable)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Add specific test commands once testing framework is configured
# Example for Python:
# pytest tests/

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Use `.env` files with `.gitignore` for local secrets
- Use repository secrets for CI/CD credentials
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Use GitHub's security advisory feature
3. Or email the maintainers privately
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
