# Getting Started with the Agents Repository

Welcome! This guide will help you understand what this repository is for and how to use it effectively.

## What is This Repository?

The **agents** repository serves three main purposes:

1. **ü§ñ Agent Governance** - Provides guidelines and configurations for automated GitHub Copilot agents
2. **üì¶ Code Import Tools** - Offers scripts and workflows to import production-ready code from the ymera_y repository
3. **üìã Documentation Hub** - Contains comprehensive documentation on best practices, policies, and procedures

## Who is This Repository For?

### Developers and Contributors
- You want to import production-ready code into your projects
- You're contributing to the repository's documentation or tools
- You need to understand agent governance policies

### Automated Agents
- You're an automated GitHub Copilot agent working in this or related repositories
- You need to follow governance guidelines for automated operations
- You're implementing features that comply with the agent code of conduct

### Curious Visitors
- You're exploring the repository to understand its purpose
- You want to learn about agent governance frameworks
- You're researching import automation patterns

## What Can You Do Here?

### 1. Import Production-Ready Code

**When to do this**: You need to bring code from the ymera-mfm/ymera_y repository into this one.

**How to do it**:
```bash
# Quick method
./import.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Or use GitHub Actions for automated imports
```

## Key Concepts

### Automated Agents

Automated agents are GitHub Copilot-powered bots that can perform tasks like:
- Responding to issues and pull requests
- Making code changes following governance rules
- Assisting with repository maintenance

All agents must follow the [Agent Code of Conduct](AGENT_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Production-Ready Code

This refers to tested, reviewed, and approved code from the ymera_y repository that's ready for production use. The import tools in this repository help bring that code here.

### Governance Framework

A set of policies, guidelines, and procedures that ensure:
- Quality standards are maintained
- Security is prioritized
- Operations are transparent
- Contributors and agents behave ethically
