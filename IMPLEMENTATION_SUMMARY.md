### 2. Governance Structure

#### GOVERNANCE.md
- **Roles Defined**:
  - Repository Maintainers (decision-making authority)
  - Contributors (proposal and implementation)
  - Automated Agents (execution within boundaries)
  
- **Decision Processes**:
  - Standard Changes (2-5 days, 1 approval)
  - Significant Changes (2-4 weeks, 2+ approvals, RFC process)
  - Emergency Changes (immediate, with post-facto review)
  
- **Quality Standards**:
  - Code quality requirements
  - Test coverage thresholds (80% minimum)
  - Security scanning requirements
  
- **Tool Management**:
  - Approval process for new tools
  - Configuration standards
  - Review and removal procedures
  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active and Enforced

### 3. Agent Compliance Framework

#### .github/workflows/agent-compliance.yml
Automated workflow that runs on:
- Pull request events
- Pushes to main/develop branches
- Manual trigger

**Compliance Checks**:
1. ‚úÖ Code of conduct files existence
2. ‚úÖ Secret scanning in changes
3. ‚úÖ Change scope validation
4. ‚úÖ Documentation update verification
5. ‚úÖ .gitignore protection
6. ‚úÖ Test file presence

**Output**: Detailed compliance summary in GitHub Actions

#### .github/agents/agent-guidelines.md
Comprehensive operational manual covering:
- **Agent Types**: Code Review, Deployment, Testing, Documentation, Security
- **Standard Operating Procedures**: Starting, executing, completing tasks
- **Tool Usage Guidelines**: Approved tools, configuration, addition/removal
- **Workflow Integration**: CI/CD pipeline, PR workflow
- **Error Handling**: Detection, response, recovery, prevention
- **Communication Protocols**: Status updates, reporting
- **Quality Assurance**: Code, testing, security standards
- **Collaboration**: Coordination mechanisms, best practices
- **Monitoring**: KPIs, continuous improvement

### 4. Tool Documentation and Analysis

#### TOOLS.md
Comprehensive documentation of all repository tools:

**Tool Categories**:
1. Version Control (Git, GitHub CLI)
2. Import and Deployment (import.sh, diagnose.sh)
3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions workflows)
4. Quality Assurance (Linters, formatters)
5. Security (Secret scanning, dependency scanning)
6. Testing (Testing frameworks, coverage tools)
7. Documentation (Markdown, linters)
8. Project Management (Issue/PR templates)

**Status Classifications**:
- ‚úÖ Configured and Active (7 tools)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended for Configuration (6 tool categories)
- üî¥ High Priority Additions (5 items)

**Includes**:
- Usage guidelines for each tool
- Configuration instructions
- Installation guides
- Best practices
- Maintenance procedures
- Adding/removing tool processes

### 5. Enhanced Security

#### Updated .gitignore
Added comprehensive patterns to prevent accidental commits:
- Enhanced secret patterns (*.key, *.pem, *secret*, credentials*)
- Build artifacts (__pycache__, dist/, build/)
- Node modules and npm files
- Testing artifacts (.coverage, .pytest_cache/)
- Package manager lock files
- Database files (*.db, *.sqlite)
- Cache directories

### 6. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
Updated to include:
- Clear reference to governance framework
- Links to all governance documents
- Explicit requirement for compliance

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Accountability
- All agent operations are logged and traceable
- Clear ownership and responsibility chains
- Automated compliance verification
- Post-operation auditing

### ‚úÖ User Advocacy
- User needs prioritized in guidelines
- Clear communication requirements
- Privacy protection mandates
- Feedback integration mechanisms

### ‚úÖ Expertise
- Domain-specific guidelines for agent types
- Best practices enforcement
- Continuous learning requirements
- Knowledge sharing protocols

### ‚úÖ Transparency
- Public decision-making processes
- Open documentation
- Clear limitation disclosure
- Complete audit trails

### ‚úÖ Quality Assurance
- Testing requirements (80% coverage minimum)
- Security scanning (automated in compliance workflow)
- Code quality standards
- Performance optimization guidelines

## Compliance Enforcement

### Automated Checks
The agent-compliance.yml workflow automatically:
- Validates code of conduct files exist
- Scans for exposed secrets
- Checks change scope appropriateness
- Verifies documentation updates
- Ensures .gitignore protection
- Confirms test coverage

### Manual Review
For significant changes:
- Human review required
- Security team involvement for security changes
- Maintainer approval for governance updates

### Violation Response
Defined processes for:
- Immediate alerts
- Operation suspension
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective actions
- Preventive measures

## Tool Management
