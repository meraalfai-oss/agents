  - No known vulnerabilities

Enforcement:
  - Automated checks in CI/CD
  - Code review requirements
  - Quality gates in pipeline
```

### Test Coverage
```yaml
Minimum Requirements:

  - Configuration changes
  - Emergency fixes (must add tests within 48h)
```

### Security
```yaml

```

## Tool Management

### Tool Approval Process

New tools must:
1. **Demonstrate value**: Clear benefit over existing tools
2. **Be compatible**: Work with current infrastructure
3. **Be maintainable**: Actively maintained and supported
4. **Be secure**: No known security issues
5. **Be documented**: Clear usage documentation

### Tool Configuration

All tools must have:

- Documentation in TOOLS.md
- Integration with CI/CD (if applicable)
- Version pinning for reproducibility

### Tool Review

Tools are reviewed:
- **Quarterly**: Regular assessment of all tools
- **On issues**: When problems are reported
- **On updates**: When major versions are released
- **On deprecation**: When tool is deprecated by maintainers

### Tool Removal

Tools can be removed when:
- No longer needed
- Better alternatives exist
- Security issues unfixable
- No longer maintained
- Causing more problems than solving

Process:
1. Assess impact of removal
2. Plan migration if needed
3. Update documentation
4. Remove from CI/CD
5. Clean up configuration
6. Archive usage documentation

## Workflow Management
